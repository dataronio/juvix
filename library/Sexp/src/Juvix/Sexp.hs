-- Folding Capabilities
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- | @foldSearchPred@ is like @foldPred@ with some notable exceptions.
-- 1. Instead of recusing on the @predChange@ form, it will just leave
--    the main form in tact.
--    - This is because in this sort of task we
--      will wish to maybe just change an aspect of it but maybe not
--      the actual form!
-- 2. We have a @predBind@ predicate which allows us to tell it what
--    forms can cause binders. This is useful when we care about what
--    is in scope for doing certain changes.
--
-- 3. In the case where both predicates match, then we will run the
--    binder and then the actual transformation, this is to ensure the
--    lexical semantics are respected, and then we can cleanup after
--    this.
--
-- 4. If the @predChange@ function accepts ":atom", then the function
--    will also be ran on the atom
--
-- For arguments, this function takes a Sexp, along with 2 sets of
-- pred function pairs. The function for the binding we take a
-- continuation, as it's not easy to automate the recursive calls in
-- instances such as case, so we have to do it by hand for those
-- binder cases
foldSearchPred ::

-- | @foldPred@ searches the sexp structure given to it with a given
-- predicate. This predicate is ran on the @car@ of every list
-- structure. This simulates searches for the head of a function
-- call. When the predicate returns true, the function passed to
-- foldPred (which we shall refer to as f), is then called on the
-- @car@, and the @cdr@ of the list, giving back a new sexp
-- structure. This new sexp structure is then recursed upon by
-- foldPred. NOTE that this does mean the structure handed back by f.
foldPred :: T -> (NameSymbol.T -> Bool) -> (Atom -> T -> T) -> T

      Cons (foldPred cs pred f) (foldPred xs pred f)
    Nil -> Nil
    Atom a -> Atom a

-- | @foldr@ works the same way as it does in Haskell. If the list is
-- terminated improperly with an atom (called a dotted list), that is
-- considered to be the last element of the list, as if it weren't a
-- dotted list.
foldr :: (T -> p -> p) -> p -> T -> p
foldr f acc ts =
  case ts of
    Cons a as -> f a (foldr f acc as)
    Atom ____ -> f ts acc
    Nil -> acc

-- | @foldr1@ works the same as it does in Haskell. Upon a dotted list,
-- it behaves like foldr. If the list is empty or nil, we return nothing
foldr1 :: (T -> T -> T) -> T -> Maybe T
foldr1 f (Cons x xs) = Just $ unsafe (Cons x xs)
  where
    unsafe ts =
      case ts of

-- | @butLast@ takes a list and removes the last element of the list,
-- if handed an atom, it will return the atom
butLast :: T -> T
butLast (Cons _ Nil) = Nil
butLast (Cons x xs) = Cons x (butLast xs)
butLast (Atom a) = Atom a
butLast Nil = Nil

-- | @last@ gives back the last element of the list, for an atom or nil
-- it will be the identity
last :: T -> T
last (Cons x Nil) = x
last (Cons _ xs) = last xs
last (Atom a) = Atom a
last Nil = Nil

-- | @list@ takes a foldable structure of Sexps and gives back a list of
-- those structures
list :: Foldable t => t T -> T
list = Std.foldr Cons Nil

-- | @listStar@ is a lot like @list@, but, it will automatically @Cons@
-- into the last structure
-- Example:
-- >>> listStar [atom "list", atom "a", atom "b", list [atom "c", atom "d"]]
-- ("list" "a" "b" "c" "d")
listStar :: [T] -> T
listStar = fromMaybe Nil . foldr1May Cons

-- | @addMetaToCar@ moves the meta information from a given atom into
-- the car of the given sexpression. If it's not a @Cons@ then it is
-- ignored.
addMetaToCar :: Atom -> T -> T
addMetaToCar (A _ lineInfo) (Cons (Atom (A term _)) xs) =
  Cons (Atom (A term lineInfo)) xs
addMetaToCar _ xs = xs

-- | @car@ grabs the head of the list
car :: T -> T
car (Cons x _) = x
car Nil = Nil
car (Atom a) = Atom a

-- | @cdr@ grabs the tail of the list
cdr :: T -> T
cdr (Cons _ xs) = xs
cdr Nil = Nil
cdr (Atom a) = Atom a

-- | @cadr@ grabs the second element of the list
cadr :: T -> T
cadr = car . cdr

-- | @atom@ creates a @Sexp@ @Atom@ from a @NameSymbol.T@
atom :: NameSymbol.T -> T
atom x = Atom $ A x Nothing

-- | @number@ creates a @Sexp@ @Number@ from an @Integer@
number :: Integer -> T
number n = Atom $ N n Nothing

-- | @isAtomNamed@ asks if an atom is named a particular name. Cons and
-- Nil both return False
isAtomNamed :: T -> NameSymbol.T -> Bool
isAtomNamed (Atom (A name _)) name2 = name == name2
isAtomNamed _ _ = False

-- | @atomFromT@ returns the Atom from the list, will returning
-- @Nothing@ if it is not an @Atom@
atomFromT :: T -> Maybe Atom
atomFromT (Atom a) = Just a
atomFromT _ = Nothing

-- | @nameFromT@ is similar to @atomFromT@ but it grabs the
-- @NameSymbol.T@ out of the @Atom@
nameFromT :: T -> Maybe NameSymbol.T
nameFromT (Atom (A name _)) = Just name
nameFromT _ = Nothing

-- | @assoc@ takes two sexps. First being a sexp that is to be found in
-- the second argument. The other is a sexp list that is grouped into
-- twos. If the search for element is found in the grouped list, then
-- the second element of that sexp is returned. Otherwise @Nothing@ is
-- returned.
-- Example:
-- >>> fmap (assoc (number 2)) (parse "((1 a) (2 b) (3 c))")
-- Right (Just "b")
assoc :: T -> T -> Maybe T
assoc t xs = cadr <$> findKey car t xs

-- | @groupBy2@ groups the given sexp structure into pairs. If the list
-- is not even, then the last element is dropped.
-- Example
-- >>> fmap groupBy2 (parse "(1 a 2 b 3 c)")
-- Right ((1 "a") (2 "b") (3 "c"))
groupBy2 :: T -> T
groupBy2 (a1 :> a2 :> rest) =
  list [a1, a2] :> groupBy2 rest
groupBy2 _ = Nil

-- | @unGroupBy2@ does the opposite of @groupBy2@. If the given list is
-- even then
-- @unGroupBy2 . groupBy2 = idl@ âˆ§ @groupBy2 .  unGroupBy2 = idr@
unGroupBy2 :: T -> T
unGroupBy2 (List [a1, a2] :> rest) =
  a1 :> a2 :> unGroupBy2 rest
unGroupBy2 (a :> rest) =
  a :> unGroupBy2 rest
unGroupBy2 a = a

-- | @snoc@ is cons but backwards. Thus it conses on the end of a given list
snoc :: T -> T -> T
snoc e (Cons x y) = Cons x (snoc e y)
snoc e a@(Atom _) = Cons a e
snoc e Nil = e

-- | @findKey searches a Sexpression structure for a particular
-- structure. the given key allows us to zoom in on a particular subset
-- of that structure.
-- >>> fmap (findKey car (number 2)) (parse "((1 a) (2 b) (3 c))")
-- Right (Just (2 "b"))
findKey :: (T -> T) -> T -> T -> Maybe T
findKey f k (x :> xs)
  | f x == k = Just x
  | otherwise = findKey f k xs
findKey _f _k _ = Nothing

-- | @flatten@ totally flattens a list, removing any extra Nils as well
-- >>> fmap flatten (parse "((1) (2 3 4) (1 2) () (1 2 (3 ())))")
-- Right (1 2 3 4 1 2 1 2 3)
flatten :: T -> T
flatten xs = rec xs Nil
  where
    rec Nil acc = acc
    rec (Atom a) acc = Cons (Atom a) acc
    rec (Cons x xs) acc = rec x (rec xs acc)
