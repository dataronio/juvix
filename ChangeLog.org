* Changelog for Juvix
** 0.1.1.3
- Split =Context= into it's own pacakge
- Tests and documentation for Utility in Core
** 0.1.1.2
- Simplifies: =Context=
  + Adds: =mapWithName=, =mapSumWithName=, and =overTopLevelMap=
  + Removes: the repeat =mapCurrentContext'= function and simplifies
    the core logic by using the new functions
** 0.1.1.1
- Adds a minimal llvm backend to the juvix compiler
** 0.1.1.0
 - _Summary_:
   + new syntax for effect handlers in Juvix.

 - _Main contributions_:
   + adds `effect` and `handler` syntaxes (also `_ via _`);
   + removes do notation as `Prelude.»=`.

*** Added Syntaxes
#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
effect Print =
  let print  : string -> unit
  let pure : x -> string
#+END_SRC
A new effect Print is defined, and its interface signature. All
effects must have a `return` clause, and hopefully operation
signatures as well (an effect without operations is just a pure
computation).

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
handler printer =
  let print  = %IO.print
  let pure x  = toString x
#+END_SRC
A handler provides an implementation of at least one effect and
a return clause, and it can implement as many operations as the
user wants.

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
let main = prog via printer
#+END_SRC
Handlers can be applied to programs using the `via` operator,
which is just a shortcut for function application.

*** Do Notation
The do notation no longer gets translated into `Prelude.»=`,
it is just another effect construct now, to be translated by
the ANF pass.
** 0.1.0.9
- Add validity predicate examples in the don't work test directories
** 0.1.0.8
- Add =Show= instances for extended =Term= and =Elim= types
** 0.1.0.7
- Fix checking of Π types
** 0.1.0.6
- Add Golden tests
** 0.1.0.5
- Split the =stack.yaml= generator into many files
** 0.1.0.4
- _Changes to =Library/Sexp.hs=_
  + Adds documentation to all functions
  + Changes =Sexp.flatten= to be a full flatten
  + Fixes a small bug in =Sexp.foldr1= where it behaves poorly with
    dotted lists
    * Tests the new behavior
  + Adds dotted list syntax to the show.
    #+begin_src haskell
      λ> (Cons (atom "hi") (atom "hi"))
      ("hi" . "hi")
    #+end_src
** 0.1.0.3
- Change: over =Juvix.Contextify.Passes= structure to use the
  S-expression generator instead of matching on the syntax directly
- Fix: A small bug where modules would drop types with an explicit
  signature
  + Test: Creates a test in =Test.Desugar.Sexp= under the
    =moduleWorksAsExpected= group
- Change: =let-type's= internal representation to more accurately
  reflect the structure

  =(:let-type name args (sum₁ sum₂ … sumₙ) rest)= instead of
  =(:let-type name (args sum₁ sum₂ … sumₙ) rest)=
** 0.1.0.2
- Switches over the =stack.yaml= depdency files to a generator to
  reduce the repeat code
- Changes some dependencies for the 3 big yaml files as they weren't
  building properly due to cyclic dependencies
** 0.1.0.1
- Compile sum and product types
- `main` can be of any type
- Refactor FromFrontend.hs into submodules
** 0.1.0.0
- Changelog created.
- Documentation around how to bump the changelog in the contributors
  guide.
